# Student Performance Monitor
A web-based application written in Python (Django) to monitor the performances of university students, particularly engineering students from Independent University, Bangladesh. It uses Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) as provided by IEB to evaluate the students.

## Run SPM Server
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/armunalam/spm.git`
2. Open the terminal (or command prompt), and `cd` into the cloned 'spm' directory.
3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment (I used `conda`).
4. Install all the prerequisites using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you have to be in the project directory to do this)
5. Run the command: `python manage.py runserver` or `python3 manage.py runserver`
6. Open a browser and go to the url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Dependencies
1. Python 3 (version 3.8.10)
2. Django (version 3.1.4)
3. NumPy
4. pandas (not required to run the server: it was used only to import dummy data from csv files)
